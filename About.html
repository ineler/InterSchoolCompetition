      Paragraph 28 of the 2030 Agenda reads: “We (Countries) commit to making fundamental changes in the way that our societies produce and consume goods and services. Governments, international organizations, the business sector and other non-state actors and individuals must contribute to changing unsustainable consumption and production patterns, including through the mobilization, from all sources, of financial and technical assistance to strengthen developing countries’ scientific, technological and innovative capacities to move towards more sustainable patterns of consumption and production. We encourage the implementation of the 10-Year Framework of Programmes on Sustainable Consumption and Production. All countries take action, with developed countries taking the lead, taking into account the development and capabilities of developing countries”.

      <p>12th SDG of government is Sustainable Consumption and Production(SCP). Achieving economic growth and sustainable development requires that we urgently reduce our ecological footprint by changing the way we produce and consume goods and resources.</p>

  <br>

  <div class="information wow animate__animated animate__bounceInRight">
      <h2>And... what is Sustainable Consumption and Production(SCP)?</h2>
      <p>Sustainable Consumption and Production is about promoting resource and energy efficiency, sustainable infrastructure, and providing access to basic services, green and decent jobs and a better quality of life for all.</p>

      The use of services and related products, which respond to basic needs and bring a better quality of life while minimizing the use of natural resources and toxic materials as well as the emissions of waste and pollutants over the life cycle of the service or product so as not to jeopardize the needs of further generations.

    <br>
    <h3>This is defined by someone but by whom and when?</h3>
    <p>
      It was defined by the Oslo Symposium in 1994.

      <p>The transition to sustainable consumption and production of goods and services is necessary to reduce the negative impact on the climate and the environment, and on people's health. Developing countries in today’s time are greatly affected by environmental impacts, which lead to increased poverty and reduced prosperity.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Sustainable consumption and production involve using resources efficiently, taking account of ecosystem services that are key to making a living, and reducing the impact of dangerous chemicals. This not only means environmental benefits but also social and economic            benefits. Sustainable consumption and production patterns are therefore a prerequisite for the transition to a green economy and sustainable development.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Sustainable consumption and production is a cross-cutting issue that complements other goals. The transition to sustainable consumption and production patterns requires a range of tools, and measures at various levels that must be implemented by various actors. Education is a very important cornerstone. Through education, people can acquire the values, knowledge and skills to be able to contribute to sustainable development. Another important cornerstone is information. Clear and easily accessible information enables consumers and other actors to make responsible and sustainable choices of products and services, and to adopt more sustainable lifestyles.</p>
